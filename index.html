        <h2>The Tragic History of Doctor Faustus</h2>
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> In *Doctor Faustus*, the protagonist, Dr. Faustus, makes a pact with the devil to gain knowledge and power, ultimately rejecting God and embracing the profane. The play portrays Faustus' internal struggle with salvation and damnation, symbolizing the conflict between religious and worldly desires.</p>
        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Marlowe’s portrayal of Faustus’ fall exemplifies the Renaissance anxiety regarding faith, power, and human agency. The tension between sacred and profane is highlighted in Faustus' rejection of God in pursuit of worldly pleasures, resulting in his damnation.</p>

        <h2>The Book of Margery Kempe</h2>
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Margery Kempe's autobiographical text records her spiritual journey, where her deep religious devotion and mystical experiences often conflict with societal norms and expectations. Her acts of piety, such as weeping and praying in public, challenge the sacred-profane divide.</p>
        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Kempe's life presents the conflict of being a devout Christian in a world that does not always accept her religious expressions. Her behavior, often seen as disruptive to the sacred order, contrasts with the more worldly aspects of society and challenges conventional boundaries between the sacred and the profane.</p>

        <h2>Comparison: Doctor Faustus and The Book of Margery Kempe</h2>
        <p>Both *Doctor Faustus* and *The Book of Margery Kempe* explore the tension between sacred and profane elements in human experience. While Faustus' journey is one of deliberate rejection of the sacred in favor of worldly power, Kempe’s experiences are a struggle to maintain her sacred devotion in a world that often deems it inappropriate or profane. These two texts highlight the varying ways in which the sacred-profane dichotomy can manifest in literature.</p>
