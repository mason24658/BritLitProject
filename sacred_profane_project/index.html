    <h2>The Tragic History of Doctor Faustus by Christopher Marlowe</h2>
    <p>In Marlowe’s play, Doctor Faustus turns away from God in his pursuit of forbidden knowledge and worldly power, ultimately falling victim to his own desires. The play dramatizes the struggle between the sacred (spiritual salvation) and the profane (worldly ambition), with Faustus’s tragic downfall as the culmination of his choices.</p>

    <h2>Comparison of the Texts</h2>
    <p>Both texts illustrate the theme of the struggle between sacred and profane, though from different perspectives. Faustus’s journey represents the dangerous allure of secular knowledge and power, while Kempe’s life reflects the challenges of living a devout life in a corrupt world.</p>
