    <!-- Doctor Faustus Section -->
    <section id="faustus">
        <h2>Doctor Faustus: The Fall from Grace</h2>
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> <span class="highlight">Doctor Faustus</span> is a tragedy by Christopher Marlowe that delves into the life of a scholar who seeks forbidden knowledge and power, selling his soul to the devil in exchange. Faustus' decision leads him on a journey of both intellectual enlightenment and spiritual destruction, as he forsakes salvation for worldly gain.</p>
        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Faustus represents the Renaissance tension between humanism and religious faith. While Faustus seeks power and knowledge, his refusal to repent reveals the dangers of pride and unchecked ambition. The play raises important questions about the limits of human knowledge and the moral cost of seeking power at the expense of spiritual values.</p>
        <p><strong>The Sacred vs. The Profane:</strong> Marlowe's Faustus highlights the conflict between the sacred and the profane as Faustus rejects the divine in favor of secular knowledge. This internal battle ultimately leads to his tragic downfall, as his pact with the devil symbolizes the danger of forsaking salvation for worldly desires.</p>

    <!-- The Book of Margery Kempe Section -->
    <section id="kempe">
        <h2>The Book of Margery Kempe: A Mystic’s Journey</h2>
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> *The Book of Margery Kempe* offers a firsthand account of a 14th-century English mystic. Margery's autobiography chronicles her vivid visions and spiritual struggles as she seeks to live a devout life, despite facing rejection from the Church and society. Her devotion to God and her spiritual experiences stand in stark contrast to the worldly pressures she faces.</p>
        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Margery's account is not only a powerful religious narrative but also a challenge to the traditional roles women were expected to play in medieval society. Her experiences represent the tension between individual devotion and societal norms. She refuses to conform to the expectations placed on women, instead pursuing a personal connection with God, even if it causes her suffering.</p>
        <p><strong>The Sacred vs. The Profane:</strong> Throughout her life, Margery is torn between her intense religious experiences and the secular world around her. Her visions and acts of devotion are often perceived as excessive, yet she remains steadfast in her belief that spiritual fulfillment transcends earthly judgment.</p>
        <div class="quote">
            "And when she was at the point of death, she cried out with a loud voice, saying, 'O my Lord Jesus, help me, for I am a sinner and in great peril.'" – *The Book of Margery Kempe*

    <!-- Comparison Section -->
    <section id="comparison">
        <h2>Comparing *Doctor Faustus* and *The Book of Margery Kempe*</h2>
        <p><strong>Doctor Faustus:</strong> In Marlowe's play, the protagonist embodies the conflict between human ambition and divine law. Faustus' rejection of the sacred for the profane represents the dangers of pride and the pursuit of power without morality. His downfall serves as a cautionary tale about the cost of forsaking faith for worldly desires.</p>
        <p><strong>The Book of Margery Kempe:</strong> In contrast, Margery’s life is defined by her unwavering commitment to God. While Faustus seeks to dominate the world, Margery seeks to transcend it, showing that spiritual fulfillment comes not from worldly power but from devout submission to God’s will.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Comparison:</strong> Both Faustus and Margery deal with the sacred and the profane, but where Faustus chooses the profane at great cost, Margery chooses the sacred despite the obstacles and ridicule she faces. Their journeys demonstrate two different paths toward understanding the human soul in relation to the divine.</p>
