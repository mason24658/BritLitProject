    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Early British literature often explores the ongoing tension between sacred duty and profane desire. In a world shaped by Christianity, characters struggle to navigate their spiritual responsibilities while facing the temptations of knowledge, power, and human passion. Two important texts, Christopher Marlowe's "Doctor Faustus" and Margery Kempe’s "The Book of Margery Kempe," reflect these struggles from strikingly different perspectives. One reveals the consequences of turning away from the sacred; the other shows the difficulty of living a sacred life in a profane world.</p>

    <h2>Doctor Faustus by Christopher Marlowe</h2>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> In "Doctor Faustus," Marlowe tells the story of a brilliant scholar who, unsatisfied with traditional knowledge, turns to necromancy to gain limitless power. Faustus willingly makes a pact with Lucifer, exchanging his soul for twenty-four years of magical abilities and worldly pleasure.</p>
    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Faustus embodies the Renaissance spirit of ambition, yet he tragically underestimates the price of forsaking divine grace. Marlowe dramatizes Faustus's internal battle between repentance and pride. Even as angels urge him to seek forgiveness, Faustus clings to despair, believing he is beyond salvation. His story illustrates how embracing the profane—worldly knowledge and dominance—leads inevitably to spiritual ruin.</p>

    <h2>The Book of Margery Kempe</h2>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> "The Book of Margery Kempe" recounts the life of a medieval woman who, after a spiritual crisis, dedicates herself entirely to God. Kempe embarks on pilgrimages, practices extreme acts of devotion, and experiences vivid religious visions, often clashing with secular authorities and common societal expectations.</p>
    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Margery Kempe’s struggle is not about falling into sin but about maintaining spiritual purity in a skeptical and often hostile world. Her loud public displays of weeping and devotion were seen by some as scandalous, blurring the line between sacred inspiration and profane disturbance. Yet her text insists that true faith may require standing apart from worldly approval, even at great personal cost.</p>

<section id="comparison">
    <h2>Comparison of "Doctor Faustus" and "The Book of Margery Kempe"</h2>
    <p>Both "Doctor Faustus" and "The Book of Margery Kempe" dramatize the tension between sacred ideals and profane realities, but they present opposite trajectories. Faustus abandons the sacred for worldly ambition, ultimately facing eternal damnation. His journey warns of the dangers of intellectual pride and the rejection of divine grace.</p>
    <p>Margery Kempe, by contrast, clings to the sacred even when it isolates her socially. Her unwavering devotion amidst mockery highlights the cost of true faith in a world governed by secular concerns. Where Faustus falls, Margery endures. Together, these works show that while the profane world may tempt, only the sacred offers salvation—even if the path is fraught with suffering.</p>
