    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Early English literature struggles with the constant conflict between sacred duty and secular desire. In a world dominated by Christianity, characters struggle to balance their sacred duties in the face of temptation from knowledge, power, and human desire. Two major works, Christopher Marlowe's "Doctor Faustus" and Margery Kempe's "The Book of Margery Kempe," respond to these challenges from radically different perspectives. One reflects the consequences of drifting away from the sacred; the other reflects the tension of living a life of the sacred in a world that is not.</p>

<section id="faustus">
    <h2>Doctor Faustus by Christopher Marlowe</h2>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> In "Doctor Faustus," Marlowe relates the story of a brilliant scholar who, in discontent with prevailing wisdom, turns to necromancy to attain unlimited power. Faustus willingly enters a contract with Lucifer, exchanging his soul for magical powers and carnal pleasures over a period of twenty-four years.</p>
    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Faustus reflects the Renaissance desire for success but tragically overestimates the price of giving up divine forgiveness. Marlowe describes Faustus's struggle between his sinful nature and a feeling of remorse. While the angels tempt him to seek forgiveness, Faustus clings to desperation, believing that he is condemned and cannot be forgiven anymore. His experience shows how getting engrossed in things worldly—the secular knowledge and domination—leads to destruction inevitably.</p>

<section id="kempe">
    <h2>The Book of Margery Kempe</h2>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> "The Book of Margery Kempe" narrates the story of a woman from the Middle Ages who, after an episode of spiritual crisis, commits her life wholeheartedly to God. Kempe makes pilgrimages, practices radical acts of devotion, and has intense visions that are commonly contrary to worldly authority and mundane society expectations.</p>
    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Margery Kempe's battle is not to become sin but to maintain spiritual innocence in a world that is doubtful and often antagonistic. Her weeping and piety in public were to some shameful, transgressing the line between sacred inspiration and secular disruption. But her writing insists that true faith means standing outside human approval, even at the expense of severe personal loss.</p>

<section id="comparison">
    <h2>Comparison of "Doctor Faustus" and "The Book of Margery Kempe"</h2>
    <p>Both "Doctor Faustus" and "The Book of Margery Kempe" dramatize the tension between sacred ideals and profane realities, but they perform opposing trajectories. Faustus sacrifices the sacred for temporal aims, moving towards eternal damnation. His tale warns against intellectual pride and rejection of divine grace.</p>
    <p>Margery Kempe, on the other hand, clings to the sacred despite its social estrangement. Her unwavering piety in the midst of derision serves to highlight the cost of true faith in a world governed by worldly interests. Where Faustus falls, Margery stands firm. Together, these works show that while the profane world will tempt, only the sacred can redeem—even if the path is fraught with suffering.</p>
